## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Can't Login?

1. Check server is running: `lsof -ti:3000`
2. Check database exists: `ls -lah cortexbuild.db`
3. Verify user exists: `sqlite3 cortexbuild.db "SELECT email, role FROM users;"`
4. Check password hash: Run `node server/update-passwords.js` again

### Wrong Dashboard?

- Each role sees different dashboard
- Super Admin → Super Admin Dashboard
- Company Admin → Company Dashboard
- Developer → Developer Console
- Supervisor → Project Dashboard

### Database Issues?

```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 cortexbuild.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# View all tables
sqlite3 cortexbuild.db ".tables"

# View users
sqlite3 cortexbuild.db "SELECT * FROM users;"
```
